\section{CUTE}
\paragraph{}This variation of CUTE expects weights, so that CUTE conditions across different correlations are the same. To use this version with no weights, assign unity weights to all the galaxies in the relevant catalogues.
This variation of CUTE uses \emph{linear} binning.

\noindent This variation of CUTE is not edited to include pair-weights.

\section{param.txt}
\paragraph{} The parameter file should point at $\mathtt{Aardvark.hdf5}$ and $\mathtt{Random.hdf5}$
Make sure the Aardvark file is correct (whether it is the complete or targeted catalogue). Random is the same for both and shouldn't matter. Both should be assigned unity weights if used with no weights.

\section{Batch Script}
\paragraph{} Required to run on CosMa, this file points at CUTE and param.txt
