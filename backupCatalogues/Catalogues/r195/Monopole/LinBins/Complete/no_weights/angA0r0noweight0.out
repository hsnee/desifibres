Initializing random number generator
First random number : 1940799983 
Using 24 threads 

*** Reading run parameters 
  Using estimator: LS

*** Setting z-distance relation from the cosmology:
 - Omega_M = 0.300 
 - Omega_L = 0.700 
 - w       = -1.000   

*** Monopole correlation function: 
 - Range: 0.000 < r < 150.150 Mpc/h
 - #bins: 64
 - Resolution: D(r) = 2.346 Mpc/h
 - Using a brute-force approach

*** Boxing catalogs 
  There will be (77,133,74) = 757834 boxes in total
  Boxes will be (dx,dy,dz) = (41.621,41.681,41.803) 
  There are objects in 29037 out of 757834 boxes 
  There are objects in 31018 out of 757834 boxes
