-----------------------------------------------------------

Initializing random number generator
First random number : 1669292390 
Using 24 threads 

*** Reading run parameters 
  Using estimator: LS

*** Setting z-distance relation from the cosmology:
 - Omega_M = 0.300 
 - Omega_L = 0.700 
 - w       = -1.000   

*** Monopole correlation function: 
 - Range: 0.000 < r < 150.150 Mpc/h
 - #bins: 64
 - Resolution: D(r) = 2.346 Mpc/h
 - Using a brute-force approach 

*** Reading catalog from file Aardvark.hdf5
CUTE: Reading HDF file 

*** Reading catalog from file Random.hdf5
CUTE: Reading HDF file 

*** Boxing catalogs 
  There will be (84,149,80) = 1001280 boxes in total
  Boxes will be (dx,dy,dz) = (40.665,40.734,40.664) 
  There are objects in 41984 out of 1001280 boxes 
  There are objects in 41950 out of 1001280 boxes 

*** Correlating 
 - Auto-correlating data      Relative time ellapsed 00:14:59 
 - Auto-correlating random      Relative time ellapsed 00:11:59 
 - Cross-correlating      Relative time ellapsed 00:31:01 

*** Writing output file mono.dat 

*** Cleaning up
             Done !!!
