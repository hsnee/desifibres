Initializing random number generator
First random number : 1394787465 
Using 24 threads 

*** Reading run parameters 
  Using estimator: LS

*** Setting z-distance relation from the cosmology:
 - Omega_M = 0.300 
 - Omega_L = 0.700 
 - w       = -1.000   

*** Monopole correlation function: 
 - Range: 0.000 < r < 150.150 Mpc/h
 - #bins: 64
 - Resolution: D(r) = 2.346 Mpc/h
 - Using a brute-force approach

*** Boxing catalogs 
  There will be (70,123,70) = 602700 boxes in total
  Boxes will be (dx,dy,dz) = (37.775,37.987,37.971) 
  There are objects in 31316 out of 602700 boxes 
  There are objects in 35013 out of 602700 boxes
