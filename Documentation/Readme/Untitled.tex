\section{CUTE}
\paragraph{}This variation of CUTE expects weights, so that CUTE conditions across different correlations are the same. To use this version with no weights, assign unity weights to all the galaxies in the relevant catalogues.

\noindent{} This variation of CUTE has been edited to include pair-weights, the subroutines edited were $\xi(r), \, \omega(\theta) \, \,\textrm{and} \, \, \xi(\sigma, \pi)$.

\noindent{} CUTE, or Correlation Utilities and Two-point Estimates, is written by David Alonso (c). For more information on CUTE, see: \href{arXiv:1210.1833v2}{arXiv:1210.1833v2}


\section{param.txt}
\paragraph{} The parameter file should point at $\mathtt{Aardvark.hdf5}$ and $\mathtt{Random.hdf5}$
Make sure the Aardvark file is correct (whether it is the complete or targeted catalogue). Random is the same for both and shouldn't matter. Both should be assigned unity weights if used with no weights.

\section{Batch Script}
\paragraph{} Required to run on CosMa, this file points at CUTE and param.txt
